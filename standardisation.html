File standardization rules are essential for maintaining consistency and readability across the codebase of a project. Implementing these rules can significantly improve collaboration and code quality. Here are some widely accepted file standardization rules that must be followed for our development tasks:

Naming Conventions:
--------------------
Use descriptive and meaningful names for files.
Use camel case with a lower starting letter (e.g. myClass.java).


File Organization:
-------------------

Maintain a clear and consistent folder structure.
Group related files into logical directories.
Avoid placing too many files in a single directory.


Code Formatting:
----------------
Use consistent indentation (usually 2 or 4 spaces) for each level of code.
Choose a consistent style for braces and parentheses placement (e.g., K&R or Allman).
Limit line length (usually less than 80 or 120 characters) to improve readability.
Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes i.e. camelCase.

  
Documentation:
--------------
Include a header comment at the beginning of each file, describing its purpose, author, and creation date.
Add inline comments to complex or hard-to-understand sections of code.
Document any external dependencies, libraries, or APIs used.
Update comments or remove deprecated code to keep documentation in sync with the actual implementation.

1. Date of development along with developer's Name.  (e.g. 20231116 - Kamran Feroz : )
2. A clear description of the content/functionality/purpose of the file.
3. In case of updation/addition/changes in the existing file, follow the same pattern and mention "Date - Dev Name: Changes Details...". Mark the same line at the beginning and end of the changes done in the file.
e.g.
20231116 - Kamran Feroz: Update query to add LastName field in condition (THIS LINE WILL BE PLACE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILE)
-------
-------
------- 
20231116 - Kamran Feroz: Update query to add LastName field in condition... START
<ACTUAL CODE WHERE CHANGES HAVE BEEN DONE>
20231116 - Kamran Feroz: Update query to add LastName field in condition... END!


Version Control:
----------------
Always use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage code changes.
Follow branching and merging best practices to handle feature development, bug fixes, and releases.
Add proper commit messages that describe the changes made in each commit.


File Permissions:
-----------------
Set appropriate file permissions to restrict access to sensitive files or directories.
Avoid storing sensitive information (like API keys, and credentials) in source code files.

  
File Size and Complexity:
-------------------------
Keep files concise and modular.
Avoid excessive file sizes and limit the number of lines within a single file.
Split large files into smaller, more manageable components.


Remember that consistency is key when implementing file standardization rules.
